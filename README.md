Where I've played!

## About eightball chronicles

As an avid pool player, I've always wanted to keep a log of places I've played. An idea that came together from the failure of another, I'm excited to use this in real life. I plan to share this with friends who are also avid players and can filter locations depending on where they are.

## Next Iteration

Update Model to Include Rating:
I would like to update my backend modeling to include a rating so that I could include that within my list of places.

Authentication:
It would be ideal to have user authentication to protect the data currently there.

User Accounts:
Expand the modeling to include a relationship for other users to have accounts and keep a list of their favorite places.
